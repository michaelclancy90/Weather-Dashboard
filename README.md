# **Weather Dashboard**

## **Introduction** 
<br />
For this project, Our goal was to create a web page that, not only, allowed the user to convert the currencies of their choice, but also gives the user an up-to-date news feed that they can browse.

<br />

## **User Story**
<br />
AS A traveler 
 <br />
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities 
 <br />
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

<br />

## **Acceptance Criteria**
<br />
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs <br />
WHEN I search for a city <br />
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history <br />
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city <br />
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index <br />
WHEN I view the UV index <br />
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe <br />
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city <br />
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity <br />
WHEN I click on a city in the search history <br />
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city <br />
